# 🥷 **Haskell Dojo Assignment 7: Functors & Applicatives**

>Source file: `src/HM/A7.hs`

### **Q#01**:
  * Write an ***IO*** action `getUpperChar` that gets an input character from the user and converts it to uppercase.
  * First identify the correct built-in ***IO*** action to use (Look it up on [hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org) using the appropriate signature if needed).
  * Do not use (`>>=`) or `do` notation in your solution. Use what you know about the ***Functor*** typeclass to accomplish the task more simply than relying on the more powerful ***Monad*** tools.

### **Q#02**:
  * Define a constant `_DICT_` that reads the contents of the file at the location specified by `_DICT_FILE` (provided), and converts the input into a list of words.
  * Use [hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org) to find the appropriate built-in function to convert a ***String*** value to a **[*String*]** value if you're not already aware of it.
  * Again, do not use (`>>=`) or `do` notation in your solution. Use what you know about the ***Functor*** typeclass to accomplish the task more simply than relying on the more powerful ***Monad*** tools.

### **Q#03**:
  * Write a function `makeGameIfValid` that takes either a ***GameException*** or a ***Secret*** value and returns either a ***GameException*** or a ***Game*** value.
  * The function should apply the `makeGame` function to the value inside the ***Either*** context, without using (`>>=`) or `do` notation.

### **Q#04**:
  * Write an action `getDict` that returns a ***Maybe Dictionary*** value inside the ***IO*** context.
  * The action should be implemented as follows:
    1. Apply the built-in `doesFileExist` action to the `_DICT_FILE_` constant, producing a value of type ***IO Bool***
    2. Use (`fmap`/`<$>`) to apply the `toMaybe` function you defined previously to the result of Step 1 (this will produce an action of type `IO (a -> Maybe a)`)
    3. You now need to apply this contextualized function to the `_DICT_` constant (`:: IO Dictionary`). Which adapter will allow us to apply a value of type ***IO* (*Dictionary* -> *Maybe Dictionary*)** to a value of type ***IO Dictionary***, producing a value of type ***IO* (*Maybe Dictionary*)**?
