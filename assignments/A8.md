# 🥷 **Haskell Dojo Assignment 8: Functors & Monads**

>Source file: `src/HM/A8.hs`

### **Q#01**:
  * Write an ***IO*** action `getUpperChar` that gets an input character from the user and converts it to uppercase.
  * First identify the correct built-in ***IO*** action to use (Look it up on [hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org) using the appropriate signature if needed).
  * Do not use (`>>=`) or `do` notation in your solution. Use what you know about the ***Functor*** typeclass to accomplish the task more simply than relying on the more powerful ***Monad*** tools.

### **Q#02**:
  * Define a constant `_DICT_` that reads the contents of the file at the location specified by `_DICT_FILE` (provided), and converts the input into a list of words.
  * Use [hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org) to find the appropriate built-in function to convert a ***String*** value to a **[*String*]** value if you're not already aware of it.
  * Again, do not use (`>>=`) or `do` notation in your solution. Use what you know about the ***Functor*** typeclass to accomplish the task more simply than relying on the more powerful ***Monad*** tools.

### **Q#03**:
  * Write a function `makeGameIfValid` that takes either a ***GameException*** or a ***Secret*** value and returns either a ***GameException*** or a ***Game*** value.
  * The function should apply the `makeGame` function to the value inside the ***Either*** context, without using (`>>=`) or `do` notation.

### **Q#04**:
  * Write an action `getDict` that returns a ***Maybe Dictionary*** value inside the ***IO*** context.
  * The action should be implemented as follows:
    1. Apply the built-in `doesFileExist` action to the `_DICT_FILE_` constant, producing a value of type ***IO Bool***
    2. Use (`fmap`/`<$>`) to apply the `toMaybe` function you defined previously to the result of Step 1 (this will produce an action of type `IO (a -> Maybe a)`)
    3. You now need to apply this contextualized function to the `_DICT_` constant (`:: IO Dictionary`). Which adapter will allow us to apply a value of type ***IO* (*Dictionary* -> *Maybe Dictionary*)** to a value of type ***IO Dictionary***, producing a value of type ***IO* (*Maybe Dictionary*)**?

### **Q#05**:
  * Write refactored versions of the `validateNoDict` and `validateWithDict` functions we defined in **Assignment 7**, using (`>>=`) to compose the component validators (instead of manually case-matching/destructuring and propagating exceptions).

### **Q#06**:
  * Write an action `playGame` that takes a ***Game*** value and returns a unit value in the ***IO*** context.
  * This is the most complex piece of program logic, so read the following instructions carefully!
  * Using `do` notation, implement the following logic:
    1. Call the `promptGuess` action from the provided code.
    2. Use the `getUpperChar` action to get a move from the user and bind the result to a variable.
    3. Call `_SPACE_`.
    4. Apply `processTurn` and pattern-match on the result using a `case` expression. You'll need to write 3 different case patterns to handle the following possibilities:
      a. **The game is over:** in this case, print the game-over message (you defined this in the ***Show*** instance for the ***GameException*** type), then print a message informing the player what the correct word was. *Hint:* remember which adapter we can use to sequence two monadic actions when we don't need the result of the first action.
      b. **Any other exception occurred:** print the exception and call `playGame` recursively with the same ***Game*** value. We're creating a looped action that will repeat until the player enters a valid move or the game ends.
      c. **An updated *Game* value was returned:** in this case, the player has entered a valid move, and the game's "state" has advanced. Print the new **Game** value, then check whether the ***Guess*** field is equal to the ***Secret*** field. If so, print a message saying that the game has been won. Otherwise, call `playGame` recursively, applying it to the updated **Game** value.
        * *Hint:* remember when using conditional expressions like `case` or `if`/`then`/`else` inside a `do` block, we need to create a nested `do` block if we want to continue writing code in `do` notation!

### **Q#07:**
  * Write an action `startGame`, which takes a validator function (:: ***Secret*** -> ***Either GameException Secret***) as input and returns a unit value in the **IO** context.
  * This action should do 2 things:
    1. Receive a secret word from the player using the `setSecret` action, and bind the result to a variable.
    2. Apply the validator function (argument) to the ***Secret*** value supplied by the player above (this produces a value of type ***Either GameException Secret***); then apply `makeGameIfValid` to this result, and with a `case` expression, match on the two possible values this returns:
      a. **An exception occurred:** the ***Secret*** value is invalid; print the exception, then call `startGame` recursively, applied to the same validator argument.
      b. **A *Game* value was returned:** print the ***Game*** value, then apply `playGame` to it to start the gameplay.

### **Q#08:**
  * The `runHM` action is essentially the `main` action for our Hangman application.
  * Replace the placeholder `putStrLn` action in `runApp` with an action that does the following:
    1. Call the `getDict` action you defined in Assignment 7 and bind its ***Maybe Dictionary*** result to a variable.
    2. Use a `case` expression to pattern-match on the result, defining patterns for the `Just` and `Nothing` possibilities.
      * If a **Dictionary** is found, partially-apply the `validateWithDict` validator to it, and pass the resulting function as an argument to `startGame`.
      * If no dictionary is found:
        * Print the following message: `"Missing dictionary file! Continue without dictionary? [Y/N]"`.
        * Then call the `getUpperChar` action you defined in Assignment 7, binding the result to a variable.
        * If the result is `Y`, apply `startGame` to the `validateNoDict` validator. We can use `if`-`then`-`else` for this, but there is monadic helper function lets us more easily perform an action conditionally like this, and returns a unit value inside the context when the predicate is `False`. Review the slides for Lesson 5 if you don't remember.
  * Your Hangman game should now be fully functional! Try running `cabal run` in the terminal to play (if you're inside a GHCi session, exit using `:q` to return to the regular terminal).
